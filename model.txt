🔁 Two-Step Voltage Generation Pipeline
Step 1: VQ-VAE (Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder)
Goal: Learn a discrete representation (codebook) of voltage signals.

🔧 Inputs:
Current signal I_p(t) (input)

Voltage signal V_real(t) (target to encode and reconstruct)

⚙️ VQ-VAE Process:
Encoder: Maps V_real(t) into a lower-dimensional latent space.

Quantization: Latents snapped to nearest codebook vectors.

Decoder: Reconstructs V_recon(t) from quantized latents.

Loss: Combination of:

Reconstruction loss (V_real vs V_recon)

Codebook loss (VQ)

Optional physics-based loss: e.g., encourage that

𝑉
𝑟
𝑒
𝑐
𝑜

Or just ensure correlation with expected physical behavior.

Step 2: Autoregressive Model (e.g., Transformer, LSTM)
Goal: Predict quantized latent voltage codes from current input

🔧 Inputs:
Current signal I_p(t)

(Optional: frequency, temperature, amplitude metadata)

🔮 Predict:
Latent tokens learned from the VQ-VAE (i.e., index sequences)

⚙️ Process:
Train the model to predict the next latent token given past tokens and the current waveform.

Once the full latent sequence is predicted → use VQ-VAE decoder to generate final voltage waveform.

✅ Advantages of This Setup:
VQ-VAE gives you:

Discrete, compressed signal tokens (less noisy)

Separates generation from representation

Autoregressive modeling on tokens:

Easier and faster to train than raw waveforms

Predicts in structured, meaningful latent space

🧠 Additional Ideas to Boost Performance:
Add a physics-informed constraint (soft or hard) to decoder output:

e.g., penalize if V_recon(t) diverges too far from -M dI/dt x

Include metadata (T, f, A) in both the encoder and autoregressive models

Add teacher forcing and scheduled sampling when training the autoregressive model

Great follow-up — let’s break it down simply.

🎓 What is Teacher Forcing?
Teacher forcing is a training technique used in sequence models (like LSTMs, Transformers, etc.) where:

At each step during training, instead of feeding the model’s own previous output, you feed the ground truth from the dataset.

Example:
You're training a model to predict this sequence of quantized voltage tokens:

python
Copy
Edit
Target sequence: [z0, z1, z2, z3, z4]
During training:

Instead of giving the model its prediction of z1 to help it predict z2, you "force" it to use the true z1.

It’s like saying:

“Don’t trust yourself yet. Let me show you the correct answer at each step so you can learn faster.”

🔥 Benefits:
Faster convergence

More stable training

Helps model learn correct short-term transitions

🔄 What is Scheduled Sampling?
Scheduled sampling is a follow-up idea that fixes a problem with teacher forcing:

During training, the model always sees perfect inputs. But at inference time, it has to use its own outputs, which may have errors.
This mismatch is called exposure bias.

🧪 Scheduled sampling mixes both:
Sometimes feed the true token (like teacher forcing).

Sometimes feed the model’s own predicted token (like inference).

Over time, increase the chance of using the model’s own predictions.

Think of it like gradually removing the training wheels.

🧠 In Your Case (Autoregressive Voltage Token Prediction):
During training:

Use teacher forcing to help the model learn correct token transitions.

Apply scheduled sampling so it gets used to its own mistakes.

During inference:

It will use only its own outputs → you decode the full latent sequence → reconstruct with VQ-VAE decoder.

🔁 Summary
Technique	What it does	When used
Teacher Forcing	Feed ground-truth token at each time step	During training
Scheduled Sampling	Mix ground-truth + model’s own token	During training (gradual transition)
Inference	Use only model’s own outputs	During prediction (testing)
Let me know if you want to add this to your training loop — I can sketch out some PyTorch-style code for it if you’d like!
